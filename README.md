About Me Website
by Alejandro Olea

Description
This About Me website, created for my Web Development I course, showcases my HTML learning achievements and personal interests through a responsive, user-friendly design built with HTML5 and CSS. The site features my biography, hobby list, photo gallery, blog article, and a contact form integrated with Netlify. It demonstrates new skills in semantic markup, CSS flexbox and grid for layouts, media queries for responsiveness across iPhone 6 (375px), iPad (768px), and larger displays (1200px+), and smooth scrolling. I used Google Fonts (Alfa Slab One and Lexend) for typography and ensured accessibility with alt text and keyboard navigation. /*The site includes a custom logo of my initals and a mobile-friendly navigation bar with a hamburger menu, enhancing usability across devices.*/
