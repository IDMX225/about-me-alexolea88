        <h2>An Excerpt From Treasure Island</h2>

        <div>

            <p>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:</p>  

            <p><em>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—<br>  
            Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"</em></p>  

            <p>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>  

            <p>"This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?"</p>  

            <p>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>  

            <p>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he cried to the man who trundled his sea-chest, "bring up alongside. I'll stay here a bit."</p>  

            <p>And with that, he threw down three or four gold pieces upon the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," said he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>  

            <p>Indeed, as he spoke, he looked around at us all, as if daring anyone to object. He was a man of few words when it came to pleasantries, but his presence was enough to command respect. His scarred face and weather-worn clothes told of battles fought on distant seas, and there was something in his eye that warned against crossing him.</p>  

            <p>My father hesitated but, seeing the gold, nodded in agreement. The strange seaman took his rum and sat by the fire, staring into the flames as if recalling some dark memory. I watched him carefully, fascinated yet wary. From that moment, the Admiral Benbow Inn was never quite the same, for with his arrival, a shadow had fallen over our quiet lives, and adventure, whether we sought it or not, had come knocking at our door.</p>
